# Deep Learning ‚Äì Lab 7 - Autoencoders

## üöÄ Tasks 

1. Upload the Autoencoder (AE) jupyter notebook file (i.e., lab_7_AE_FFNN.ipynb) to google colab root directory.
     - In this code, an image reconstruction is done using dense layers-based AE.
     - Fashion MNIST dataset is used for this task (also for the subsequent tasks as well).
     - Run the above code and understand it.
     - Train the model with 30 epochs.
     - Write the code implementation to calculate the loss (Mean Squared Error) for the test dataset.
     - Write the code implementation to plot the train and validation loss against number of epochs.
     </br>

2. When above AE is used without activation functions, it is called a linear AE. Explain the relationship between linear AE and principal component analysis (PCA). Write the answer in a word file. </br>

3. Upload the Vanilla CNN AE jupyter notebook file (i.e., lab_7_AE_Vanilla_CNN.ipynb) to google colab root directory.
     - In this code, instead of dense layers, 2D CNN layers are used.
     - Task in the same as before with the same Fashion MNIST dataset.
     - Run the above code and understand it.
     - Train the model with 30 epochs.
     - Write the code implementation to calculate the loss (Mean Squared Error) for the test dataset.
     - Write the code implementation to plot the train and validation loss against number of epochs.
    </br>
4.	Observe the model performance improvements between the above two models and give reasons for the observed improvements.  </br>
5.	Upload the Image De-noising AE jupyter notebook file (i.e., lab_7_AE_CNN_Image_Denoising.ipynb) to google colab root directory.  </br>
     - In this code, noise is first added to the images before the reconstruction.
     - This is a method to overcome the overfitting that happens in AEs.
     - Run the above code and understand it.
     - Train the model with 30 epochs.
     - Write the code implementation to calculate the loss (Mean Squared Error) for the test dataset.
     - Write the code implementation to plot the train and validation loss against number of epochs.
     - Experiment with ‚Äúnoise_factor‚Äù value and use the best value you find in the final implementation. (Pay attention to how this value affect the images by observing the noise added images in the code.)
        </br>
6.	Observe the model performance improvements between the Image De-noising AE and the Vanilla CNN AE.
     - Explain the reasons for the observed improvements.
        </br>
7.	Explain the differences between AE and Variational AE (VAE).
